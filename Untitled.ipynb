    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. \n",

    "As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because color doesnt affect the shape of the sign, grayscale images would make the model smaller and more efficient\n",

    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",

    "My final model results were:\n",

    "\n",

    "first i tried to enlarge the lenet architecture because it's designed for 10 classes and we have 43 classes\n",
    "\n",
    "* What were some problems with the initial architecture?\n",
    "the problem was that the model getting stuck in a local minima and the validation accuaracy never pass 5%\n",
    "\n",
    "* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? \n",
    "i tried using sigmoid instead of relu that worked but it was too slow in learning parameters so i rolled back to relu and tried another method of initializing the weights and that worked very well but the model where too big to be trained in 100 epochs so i rolled back the model of lenet5 and without enlargement and it worked really good.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?\n",
    "learning rate: changing the number passed to the constructor of the optimizer\n",
    "i tried to make it 0.01 instead of 0.001 to accelerate the learning process but it affect the training accuarcy so i rolled back to 0.001\n",
    "conv layer size: by changing the dimention of weights and filter\n",
    "dropout: i tried values of 1 and 0.5 for it \n",
    "batch size: 128 and 256\n",
    "epochs: 80, 1000, 100\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?\n",
    "convolution layer looks for some features in the whole image and this works well in classifying models\n",
    "drop out is a very good technique to reduce overfitting, the problem when i have a high accuarcy in the training set but a lower accuaracy in the validation set\n",
    "\n",
    "If a well known architecture was chosen:\n",
    "* What architecture was chosen? \n",
    "lenet5\n",
    "* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application? \n",
    "because i studied it the course :D and it is a basic architecture that is been used in classifying models\n",
    "* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?\n",
    "very high accuarcy in all of them provided evidence that the model is working well\n",
    "and a low difference from the training and validation accuracy\n",
